April 1.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Carmen from Lima,Peru
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science (I'm a systems engineer but I want to redirect to this wonderful branch )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything related to Data Science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .... (First of all, I want to enhance my knowledge related to DS and create some small/medium projects because the 
last years I was focused on doing things related to QA analysis and Database Operation and then of course collaborate in open source projects)
- 📫 my personal email is: carmenjkr@gmail.com

These are my First Steps.

I will be uploading some projects/labs related to DS base in my learning process in several MOOCS.

******** I will update this file with my reached goals, maybe It'll be difficult but Rome was not created in One day *********
